~mongoTools~ is an ~R~ package to simplify building mongoDB queries. It is meant to complement the excellent [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mongolite/index.html][mongolite]] package.

* Installation
You can install the package directly from github using the ~devtools~ package:
#+begin_src R
devtools::install_github("tkharrat/mongoTools")
#+end_src

We also provide a conda recipe to install the package. The latest version is usually available on my channel:
 #+begin_src shell
 conda install r-mongotools -c tkharrat -c conda-forge
 #+end_src
* How to use it?
** Connecting to a ~mongoDB~ server
** Queries
